              year, your ZIP code, your household size and your age. If you are
              a low- or moderate-income Californian, you may get help buying
              insurance from Covered California through monthly subsidies that
              lower your premium costs so that you pay less for top-quality,
              brand-name insurance. Learn more about
              who qualifies for a subsidy.

For many individuals who enroll in Medi-Cal, there is no premium,
              no co-payment, and no out of pocket cost. Some households will see
              affordable costs, such as a low monthly premium. For some Medi-Cal
              children, the monthly premiums are $13 per child up to a family
              maximum of $39 per month. In general, individuals in Medi-Cal will
              get the same health benefits available through Covered California
              at a lower cost.
