The extension is granted under section 1111.5 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code (CUIC) if the Governor declares a state of emergency. The request for extension to report and pay may be in writing or requested by calling the Taxpayer Assistance Center at 1-888-745-3886. For additional information, refer to Information Sheet: State of Emergency or Disaster (DE 231SED) (PDF).

When requesting an extension, employers must specifically state that the request is made pursuant to section 1111.5 of the CUIC. The request must also provide detailed information as to why the report(s) and/or payment(s) could not be submitted in a timely manner and must be submitted before or within two months of the original delinquent date of the return or payment.

Employment Development DepartmentPO Box 826880Sacramento, CA 94280-0001
Reconstructing Payroll Records
If employer payroll records were lost or destroyed due to a disaster, it will be necessary to reconstruct the records in order to file any missing returns and remit any payroll taxes due. If information is not available to determine the exact wages paid, employers may make reasonable estimates based on the best information available. The EDD can provide employers with copies of previously filed reports which may serve as a basis for their estimates. For further information or to request copies of previously filed reports, call the Taxpayer Assistance Center at 1-888-745-3886.
Work Sharing
Employers should consider using the Work Sharing program as a temporary alternative to any layoffs if business production or services have reduced.
Disaster Relief Payments
Effective in tax years after September 11, 2001, qualified disaster relief payments (as defined in section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code [IRC]) made by an employer are not subject to PIT withholding or reportable as PIT wages under sections 13006, 13009(q), and 13009.5 of the CUIC. However, disaster relief payments paid by employers are subject to UI, ETT, and SDI (includes Paid Family Leave) unless excluded under section 938 of the CUIC, as payment resulting from the death of an employee.
A qualified disaster relief payment is defined by section 139(b) of the IRC as any amount paid to or for the benefit of an individual:
(1) to reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary personal, family, living, or funeral expenses incurred as a result of a qualified disaster,
(2) to reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for the repair or rehabilitation of a personal residence or repair or replacement of its contents to the extent that the need for such repair, rehabilitation, or replacement is attributable to a qualified disaster,
(3) by a person engaged in the furnishing or sale of transportation as a common carrier by reason of the death or personal physical injuries incurred as a result of a qualified disaster, or
(4) if such amount is paid by a federal, state, or local government, or agency or instrumentality thereof, in connection with a qualified disaster in order to promote the general welfare, but only to the extent any expense compensated by such payment (as indicated in items 1-4 above) is not compensated by insurance or otherwise.
A qualified disaster is defined by section 139(c) of the IRC as:
(1) a disaster that results from a terroristic or military action (as defined in section 692(c)[2] of the IRC),
(2) a federally declared disaster (as defined in section 1033(h)[3] of the IRC),
(3) a disaster which results from an accident involving a common carrier, or from any other event which is determined by the Secretary (of Treasury) to be of a catastrophic nature, or
(4) with respect to amounts described in section 139(b) item (4) above, a disaster which is determined by an applicable federal, state, or local authority as determined by the Secretary (of Treasury) to warrant such assistance from the federal, state, or local government or agency or instrumentality thereof.
Additional information about emergencies and disasters can be found on the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services’ website.

Requests for Extension to Report and Pay
California employers directly affected by an emergency or disaster may request an extension of up to two months to file their state payroll reports and to deposit state payroll taxes with the EDD, without penalty or interest. The extension is granted under section 1111.5 of the California Unemployment Insurance Code (CUIC) if the Governor declares a state of emergency. The request for extension to report and pay may be in writing or requested by calling the Taxpayer Assistance Center at 1-888-745-3886. For additional information, refer to Information Sheet: State of Emergency or Disaster (DE 231SED) (PDF).
State payroll taxes include Unemployment Insurance (UI), Employment Training Tax (ETT), State Disability Insurance (SDI) (includes Paid Family Leave), and California Personal Income Tax (PIT). When requesting an extension, employers must specifically state that the request is made pursuant to section 1111.5 of the CUIC. The request must also provide detailed information as to why the report(s) and/or payment(s) could not be submitted in a timely manner and must be submitted before or within two months of the original delinquent date of the return or payment. Section 1111.5 of the CUIC does not include reimbursable Unemployment Insurance payments.
Written requests for extension to report and pay can be mailed to:
Employment Development DepartmentPO Box 826880Sacramento, CA 94280-0001
Reconstructing Payroll Records
If employer payroll records were lost or destroyed due to a disaster, it will be necessary to reconstruct the records in order to file any missing returns and remit any payroll taxes due. If information is not available to determine the exact wages paid, employers may make reasonable estimates based on the best information available. The EDD can provide employers with copies of previously filed reports which may serve as a basis for their estimates. For further information or to request copies of previously filed reports, call the Taxpayer Assistance Center at 1-888-745-3886.
Work Sharing
Employers should consider using the Work Sharing program as a temporary alternative to any layoffs if business production or services have reduced.
Disaster Relief Payments
Effective in tax years after September 11, 2001, qualified disaster relief payments (as defined in section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code [IRC]) made by an employer are not subject to PIT withholding or reportable as PIT wages under sections 13006, 13009(q), and 13009.5 of the CUIC. However, disaster relief payments paid by employers are subject to UI, ETT, and SDI (includes Paid Family Leave) unless excluded under section 938 of the CUIC, as payment resulting from the death of an employee.
A qualified disaster relief payment is defined by section 139(b) of the IRC as any amount paid to or for the benefit of an individual:
(1) to reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary personal, family, living, or funeral expenses incurred as a result of a qualified disaster,
(2) to reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for the repair or rehabilitation of a personal residence or repair or replacement of its contents to the extent that the need for such repair, rehabilitation, or replacement is attributable to a qualified disaster,
(3) by a person engaged in the furnishing or sale of transportation as a common carrier by reason of the death or personal physical injuries incurred as a result of a qualified disaster, or
(4) if such amount is paid by a federal, state, or local government, or agency or instrumentality thereof, in connection with a qualified disaster in order to promote the general welfare, but only to the extent any expense compensated by such payment (as indicated in items 1-4 above) is not compensated by insurance or otherwise.
A qualified disaster is defined by section 139(c) of the IRC as:
(1) a disaster that results from a terroristic or military action (as defined in section 692(c)[2] of the IRC),
(2) a federally declared disaster (as defined in section 1033(h)[3] of the IRC),
(3) a disaster which results from an accident involving a common carrier, or from any other event which is determined by the Secretary (of Treasury) to be of a catastrophic nature, or
(4) with respect to amounts described in section 139(b) item (4) above, a disaster which is determined by an applicable federal, state, or local authority as determined by the Secretary (of Treasury) to warrant such assistance from the federal, state, or local government or agency or instrumentality thereof.
Additional information about emergencies and disasters can be found on the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services’ website.

**Provider**: California Fires or other California Disasters may be eligible for property tax relief, please refer to our Disaster Relief webpage for more information. Additional resources are available at CA.gov/LAfires for Californians impacted by the Los Angeles Fires.

### Deadlines

- Extension

### Eligibility

- Disaster Relief Information - Property owners affected by California Fires or other California Disasters may be eligible for property tax relief, please refer to our Disaster Relief webpage for more information. Additional resources are available at CA.gov/LAfires for Californians impacted by the Los Angeles Fires.
- Revenue and Taxation Code section 170 provides that if a calamity such as fire, earthquake, or flooding damages or destroys your property, you may be eligible for property tax relief if the county where your property is located has adopted an ordinance that allows property tax relief to owners of damaged or destroyed property, without fault from the assessee. In such cases, the county assessor will reappraise the property to reflect its damaged condition. In addition, when it is rebuilt in a like or similar manner, the property will retain its prior value (Proposition 13) for tax purposes. All California counties have adopted an ordinance for disaster relief.
- To qualify for property tax relief, you must file a claim with the county assessor within the time specified in your county ordinance, or 12 months from the date of damage or destruction, whichever is later. The loss estimate must be at least $10,000 of current market value to qualify the property for this relief. The property will be reassessed according to its damaged state and property taxes will be adjusted accordingly.
- To qualify for property tax relief under section 170, you must file a claim with the county assessor within 12 months from the date of damage or destruction, or the time specified in your county ordinance, whichever is later. There must be at least a $10,000 estimated loss of current market value to qualify the property for this relief.
									After an application is processed by the county assessor's office, a notice of proposed new assessment will be sent to you. Subsequently, a separate supplemental refund will be made based on the amount of reduction. The refund will be prorated from the month in which the disaster occurred to the end of the fiscal year or completion of new construction, whichever is first. You do not have to file a separate claim for refund. However, you must still pay your regular tax bill.
The form and its title differ from county to county; therefore, you must contact your county assessor for an application for reassessment for property damaged or destroyed by misfortune or calamity. In some cases, the form may be downloaded from the county's website. You may find your assessor's contact information by visiting the Listing of County Assessors.
- While section 170 is one form of relief that may be available when a disaster strikes, depending on the nature of your property, you may be eligible for additional relief. The chart below lists additional relief that may be available to you based on property type and the type of disaster that occurred. The listed Revenue and Taxation Code will provide the requirements of each relief option.
- To qualify for deferral, for property receiving a homeowners' exemption, "substantial disaster damage" means damage amounting to at least 10 percent of its fair market value or $10,000 whichever is less. For all other property, the damage must be at least 20 percent of value. However, tax deferral is not available where property taxes are paid through impound accounts.
- If your property has been substantially damaged or destroyed in a Governor-proclaimed disaster, you may be eligible for a reinstatement of your homeâs previous base year value. To be eligible, you must file a disaster relief claim with the county assessor to reduce your taxes and rebuild the property in a like or similar manner. Alternatively, you may choose to buy another comparable property and transfer your base year value to the new property. You will not be able to do both.
- It must be eligible for the homeowners' or disabled veterans' exemption (your principal place of residence).
- The claimant must be an owner and a resident of the original property, and therefore eligible for the homeowners' or disabled veterans' exemption, either at the time of its sale or within two years of the purchase or new construction of the replacement dwelling.

To qualify for property tax relief, you must file a claim with the county assessor within the time specified in your county ordinance, or 12 months from the date of damage or destruction, whichever is later. The loss estimate must be at least $10,000 of current market value to qualify the property for this relief. The property will be reassessed according to its damaged state and property taxes will be adjusted accordingly.
This property tax relief is available to owners of real property, business equipment and fixtures, orchards or other agricultural groves, and to owners of aircraft, boats, and certain manufactured homes – it is not available to property that is not assessable, such as state licensed manufactured homes or household furnishings.

Base Year Value Transfer to Replacement Property

Existing law also allows three different types of base year value transfers for property owners whose real property was substantially damaged or destroyed by a disaster for which the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency. Each of these provisions was enacted by Constitutional amendment and implemented by statute.
On June 3, 1986, the voters of California approved Proposition 50, adding subdivisions (e) and (f) to section 2 of article XIII A of the California Constitution to allow the transfer of the base year value of real property that is substantially damaged or destroyed by a disaster for which the Governor proclaims a state of emergency to comparable replacement property located within the same county. These provisions are implemented by Revenue and Taxation Code (RTC) section 69.
On November 2, 1993, California voters approved Proposition 171, which amended section 2(e) of article XIII A, to allow the base year value of a principal residence substantially damaged or destroyed in a disaster for which the Governor proclaims a state of emergency to be transferred to a replacement principal residence located in another county, provided that the replacement residence is located in a county that has adopted an ordinance to accept such base year value transfers.2 These provisions are implemented by RTC section 69.3.
On November 3, 2020, California voters approved Proposition 19, which added section 2.1 to article XIII A, to allow, as relevant here, an owner of a primary residence who is a victim of a wildfire or natural disaster to transfer the taxable value of their original primary residence to a replacement primary residence that is purchased or newly constructed as that person's principal residence within two years of the sale of the original primary residence. Proposition 19 became operative as of April 1, 2021.





To qualify for property tax relief under section 170, you must file a claim with the county assessor within 12 months from the date of damage or destruction, or the time specified in your county ordinance, whichever is later. There must be at least a $10,000 estimated loss of current market value to qualify the property for this relief.
									After an application is processed by the county assessor's office, a notice of proposed new assessment will be sent to you. Subsequently, a separate supplemental refund will be made based on the amount of reduction. The refund will be prorated from the month in which the disaster occurred to the end of the fiscal year or completion of new construction, whichever is first. You do not have to file a separate claim for refund. However, you must still pay your regular tax bill.
The form and its title differ from county to county; therefore, you must contact your county assessor for an application for reassessment for property damaged or destroyed by misfortune or calamity. In some cases, the form may be downloaded from the county's website. You may find your assessor's contact information by visiting the Listing of County Assessors.



For relief under section 69, a claim must be filed with the Assessor of the county where the damaged/destroyed home is located.
For relief under section 69.3, a claim must be filed with the Assessor of the county in which the replacement property is located within three years after the replacement property is acquired or newly constructed.
For relief under section 2.1(b) of article XIII A of the California Constitution (RTC section 69.6), a claim must be filed with the Assessor of the county in which the replacement property is located within three years of the purchase or new construction of the replacement property for full relief. If this period is missed, prospective relief is available for the lien date of the assessment year in which the claim is filed.

1. My home was damaged by a fire. What do I do? Where do I start?

If your property has been damaged by a calamity, you need to file a disaster relief claim with the county assessor. This will allow your current property taxes to be reduced for that portion of the property damaged or destroyed. This reduction will be from the first of the month in which the damage occurred, and will remain in effect until the property is rebuilt or repaired. Some county assessors have the authority to reduce a property's value for damage without a disaster relief claim. Please check with your county assessor's office to verify whether a claim is required.
In addition, if your property has been substantially damaged or destroyed in a Governor-proclaimed disaster and you have either filed a disaster relief claim with the county assessor to reduce your taxes or have been granted disaster relief by the assessor, you may file a claim to postpone the next installment of property taxes that occurs immediately after the disaster. If you file a "property tax deferral claim" with the county assessor before the next property tax installment payment date, that payment will be postponed without penalty or interest until the county assessor has reassessed the property and you receive a corrected tax bill.
To qualify for deferral, for property receiving a homeowners' exemption, "substantial disaster damage" means damage amounting to at least 10 percent of its fair market value or $10,000 whichever is less. For all other property, the damage must be at least 20 percent of value. However, tax deferral is not available where property taxes are paid through impound accounts.

2. My property and/or home were damaged and the Governor proclaimed a disaster in my area. What type of relief is available?

If your property has been substantially damaged or destroyed in a Governor-proclaimed disaster, you may be eligible for a reinstatement of your homeâs previous base year value. To be eligible, you must file a disaster relief claim with the county assessor to reduce your taxes and rebuild the property in a like or similar manner. Alternatively, you may choose to buy another comparable property and transfer your base year value to the new property. You will not be able to do both.
Can I buy another house in the same county and transfer the base year value of my damaged house to my new house?
Yes, section 69 provides for this relief to you under certain circumstances:
The damaged property must amount to more than 50 percent of its full cash value immediately prior to the disaster. This applies to any type of real property, not just residences.
The property must be transferred to a comparable replacement property, acquired or newly constructed, within the same county and within five years after the disaster.
Comparability is crucial – the replacement property must be similar in size, utility, and function to the property which it replaces.
The replacement property must not exceed 120 percent of the full cash value of the property damaged or destroyed. Any amount of the full cash value of the replacement property that exceeds 120 percent of the full cash value of the damaged property (immediately prior to the damage) shall be added to the adjusted base year value of the damaged property. The sum of these amounts shall become the replacement property's replacement base year value.
Please contact your county assessor's office for an application.
Can I buy another house in a different county and transfer the base year value of my damaged house to my new house?
Under section 69.3, a principal residence that was damaged in an area that was a Governor-proclaimed disaster that occurred on or after October 20, 1991 may have its base year value transferred to a replacement residence in a different county only if the county has adopted an ordinance that allows such taxable value transfers. As of June 7, 2018, there are 11 counties that have such an ordinance: Contra Costa, Los Angeles, Modoc, Orange, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, and Ventura. The replacement residence must meet the following criteria:

It must be purchased within three years of the disaster.
Its market value must be of equal or lesser value than the market value of the damaged property immediately prior to the date of the disaster. Depending upon the year in which the replacement property is purchased, the market value of the damaged property is adjusted up to 115 percent when comparing with the replacement property.
It must be eligible for the homeowners' or disabled veterans' exemption (your principal place of residence).
Claims for this exclusion must be filed with the county assessor within three years of the purchase of the replacement property.

Under article XIII A, section 2.1(b), an owner of a principal residence who is a victim of a wildfire or Governor proclaimed natural disaster may transfer the taxable value of their primary residence to a replacement primary residence located anywhere in this state, regardless of the location or value of the replacement primary residence, that is purchased or newly constructed as that person's principal residence within two years of the sale of the original primary residence.

The claimant must be an owner and a resident of the original property, and therefore eligible for the homeowners' or disabled veterans' exemption, either at the time of its sale or within two years of the purchase or new construction of the replacement dwelling.
The damaged property must amount to more than 50 percent of its full cash value immediately prior to the disaster.
Either the sale of the original property or the purchase or new construction of the replacement dwelling, must occur on or after April 1, 2021.
If the value of the replacement primary residence is greater than the value of the original primary residence, the taxable value of the replacement primary residence shall be calculated by adding the difference between the full cash value of the original primary residence and the full cash value of the replacement primary residence to the taxable value of the original primary residence.
Claims for this exclusion must be filed with the county assessor within three years of the date the replacement dwelling was purchased or the new construction of the replacement dwelling was completed.


3. After my property is rebuilt or repaired following the damage, will my property taxes be increased over what they were before?

No. Property owners will retain their previous factored base year value if the house is rebuilt in a like or similar manner, regardless of the actual cost of construction. However, any new square footage or extras, such as additional baths, will be added to the base year value at its full market value.

4. Our home was damaged from a forest fire last September and we had to move out while it is being repaired.Â  Are we still allowed the homeowner's exemption even though we have not returned to our house as of January 1?

Yes. Temporary absence from a dwelling for repairs made necessary by a natural disaster will not result in the loss of your homeowner's exemption as long as you have not established permanent housing elsewhere.

5. Which counties accept base year transfers from other counties under section 69.3?

As of May 6, 2021, the following 14 counties have enacted ordinances that allow a base year value transfer for a principal residence that was substantially damaged or destroyed by a Governor-proclaimed disaster:

Contra Costa
Glenn
Los Angeles
Modoc
Orange
San Diego
San Francisco
Santa Clara
Solano
Sonoma
Sutter
Ventura
Yolo
Yuba
- If you have been impacted by the recent flooding or fires in California, property tax relief is available to you. See the list of Governor Proclaimed Disasters and find your California County Assessor for additional information.

Reduction of Assessed Value while Property is in its Damaged Condition

Revenue and Taxation Code section 170 provides that if a calamity such as fire, earthquake, or flooding damages or destroys your property, you may be eligible for property tax relief if the county where your property is located has adopted an ordinance that allows property tax relief to owners of damaged or destroyed property, without fault from the assessee. In such cases, the county assessor will reappraise the property to reflect its damaged condition. In addition, when it is rebuilt in a like or similar manner, the property will retain its prior value (Proposition 13) for tax purposes. All California counties have adopted an ordinance for disaster relief.
To qualify for property tax relief, you must file a claim with the county assessor within the time specified in your county ordinance, or 12 months from the date of damage or destruction, whichever is later. The loss estimate must be at least $10,000 of current market value to qualify the property for this relief. The property will be reassessed according to its damaged state and property taxes will be adjusted accordingly.
This property tax relief is available to owners of real property, business equipment and fixtures, orchards or other agricultural groves, and to owners of aircraft, boats, and certain manufactured homes – it is not available to property that is not assessable, such as state licensed manufactured homes or household furnishings.

Base Year Value Transfer to Replacement Property

Existing law also allows three different types of base year value transfers for property owners whose real property was substantially damaged or destroyed by a disaster for which the Governor proclaimed a state of emergency. Each of these provisions was enacted by Constitutional amendment and implemented by statute.
On June 3, 1986, the voters of California approved Proposition 50, adding subdivisions (e) and (f) to section 2 of article XIII A of the California Constitution to allow the transfer of the base year value of real property that is substantially damaged or destroyed by a disaster for which the Governor proclaims a state of emergency to comparable replacement property located within the same county. These provisions are implemented by Revenue and Taxation Code (RTC) section 69.
On November 2, 1993, California voters approved Proposition 171, which amended section 2(e) of article XIII A, to allow the base year value of a principal residence substantially damaged or destroyed in a disaster for which the Governor proclaims a state of emergency to be transferred to a replacement principal residence located in another county, provided that the replacement residence is located in a county that has adopted an ordinance to accept such base year value transfers.2 These provisions are implemented by RTC section 69.3.
On November 3, 2020, California voters approved Proposition 19, which added section 2.1 to article XIII A, to allow, as relevant here, an owner of a primary residence who is a victim of a wildfire or natural disaster to transfer the taxable value of their original primary residence to a replacement primary residence that is purchased or newly constructed as that person's principal residence within two years of the sale of the original primary residence. Proposition 19 became operative as of April 1, 2021.





To qualify for property tax relief under section 170, you must file a claim with the county assessor within 12 months from the date of damage or destruction, or the time specified in your county ordinance, whichever is later. There must be at least a $10,000 estimated loss of current market value to qualify the property for this relief.
									After an application is processed by the county assessor's office, a notice of proposed new assessment will be sent to you. Subsequently, a separate supplemental refund will be made based on the amount of reduction. The refund will be prorated from the month in which the disaster occurred to the end of the fiscal year or completion of new construction, whichever is first. You do not have to file a separate claim for refund. However, you must still pay your regular tax bill.
The form and its title differ from county to county; therefore, you must contact your county assessor for an application for reassessment for property damaged or destroyed by misfortune or calamity. In some cases, the form may be downloaded from the county's website. You may find your assessor's contact information by visiting the Listing of County Assessors.



For relief under section 69, a claim must be filed with the Assessor of the county where the damaged/destroyed home is located.
For relief under section 69.3, a claim must be filed with the Assessor of the county in which the replacement property is located within three years after the replacement property is acquired or newly constructed.
For relief under section 2.1(b) of article XIII A of the California Constitution (RTC section 69.6), a claim must be filed with the Assessor of the county in which the replacement property is located within three years of the purchase or new construction of the replacement property for full relief. If this period is missed, prospective relief is available for the lien date of the assessment year in which the claim is filed.

For all other property, the damage must be at least 20 percent of value. However, tax deferral is not available where property taxes are paid through impound accounts.

2. My property and/or home were damaged and the Governor proclaimed a disaster in my area. What type of relief is available?

If your property has been substantially damaged or destroyed in a Governor-proclaimed disaster, you may be eligible for a reinstatement of your homeâs previous base year value. To be eligible, you must file a disaster relief claim with the county assessor to reduce your taxes and rebuild the property in a like or similar manner. Alternatively, you may choose to buy another comparable property and transfer your base year value to the new property. You will not be able to do both.
Can I buy another house in the same county and transfer the base year value of my damaged house to my new house?
Yes, section 69 provides for this relief to you under certain circumstances:
The damaged property must amount to more than 50 percent of its full cash value immediately prior to the disaster. This applies to any type of real property, not just residences.
The property must be transferred to a comparable replacement property, acquired or newly constructed, within the same county and within five years after the disaster.
Comparability is crucial – the replacement property must be similar in size, utility, and function to the property which it replaces.
The replacement property must not exceed 120 percent of the full cash value of the property damaged or destroyed. Any amount of the full cash value of the replacement property that exceeds 120 percent of the full cash value of the damaged property (immediately prior to the damage) shall be added to the adjusted base year value of the damaged property. The sum of these amounts shall become the replacement property's replacement base year value.
Please contact your county assessor's office for an application.
Can I buy another house in a different county and transfer the base year value of my damaged house to my new house?
Under section 69.3, a principal residence that was damaged in an area that was a Governor-proclaimed disaster that occurred on or after October 20, 1991 may have its base year value transferred to a replacement residence in a different county only if the county has adopted an ordinance that allows such taxable value transfers. As of June 7, 2018, there are 11 counties that have such an ordinance: Contra Costa, Los Angeles, Modoc, Orange, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, and Ventura. The replacement residence must meet the following criteria:

It must be purchased within three years of the disaster.
Its market value must be of equal or lesser value than the market value of the damaged property immediately prior to the date of the disaster. Depending upon the year in which the replacement property is purchased, the market value of the damaged property is adjusted up to 115 percent when comparing with the replacement property.
It must be eligible for the homeowners' or disabled veterans' exemption (your principal place of residence).
Claims for this exclusion must be filed with the county assessor within three years of the purchase of the replacement property.

Under article XIII A, section 2.1(b), an owner of a principal residence who is a victim of a wildfire or Governor proclaimed natural disaster may transfer the taxable value of their primary residence to a replacement primary residence located anywhere in this state, regardless of the location or value of the replacement primary residence, that is purchased or newly constructed as that person's principal residence within two years of the sale of the original primary residence.

The claimant must be an owner and a resident of the original property, and therefore eligible for the homeowners' or disabled veterans' exemption, either at the time of its sale or within two years of the purchase or new construction of the replacement dwelling.
The damaged property must amount to more than 50 percent of its full cash value immediately prior to the disaster.
Either the sale of the original property or the purchase or new construction of the replacement dwelling, must occur on or after April 1, 2021.
If the value of the replacement primary residence is greater than the value of the original primary residence, the taxable value of the replacement primary residence shall be calculated by adding the difference between the full cash value of the original primary residence and the full cash value of the replacement primary residence to the taxable value of the original primary residence.
Claims for this exclusion must be filed with the county assessor within three years of the date the replacement dwelling was purchased or the new construction of the replacement dwelling was completed.


3. After my property is rebuilt or repaired following the damage, will my property taxes be increased over what they were before?

No. Property owners will retain their previous factored base year value if the house is rebuilt in a like or similar manner, regardless of the actual cost of construction. However, any new square footage or extras, such as additional baths, will be added to the base year value at its full market value.

4. Our home was damaged from a forest fire last September and we had to move out while it is being repaired.Â  Are we still allowed the homeowner's exemption even though we have not returned to our house as of January 1?

Yes. Temporary absence from a dwelling for repairs made necessary by a natural disaster will not result in the loss of your homeowner's exemption as long as you have not established permanent housing elsewhere.

5. Which counties accept base year transfers from other counties under section 69.3?

As of May 6, 2021, the following 14 counties have enacted ordinances that allow a base year value transfer for a principal residence that was substantially damaged or destroyed by a Governor-proclaimed disaster:

Contra Costa
Glenn
Los Angeles
Modoc
Orange
San Diego
San Francisco
Santa Clara
Solano
Sonoma
Sutter
Ventura
Yolo
Yuba
- To qualify for property tax relief under section 170, you must file a claim with the county assessor within 12 months from the date of damage or destruction, or the time specified in your county ordinance, whichever is later. There must be at least a $10,000 estimated loss of current market value to qualify the property for this relief.
									After an application is processed by the county assessor's office, a notice of proposed new assessment will be sent to you. Subsequently, a separate supplemental refund will be made based on the amount of reduction. The refund will be prorated from the month in which the disaster occurred to the end of the fiscal year or completion of new construction, whichever is first. You do not have to file a separate claim for refund. However, you must still pay your regular tax bill.
The form and its title differ from county to county; therefore, you must contact your county assessor for an application for reassessment for property damaged or destroyed by misfortune or calamity. In some cases, the form may be downloaded from the county's website. You may find your assessor's contact information by visiting the Listing of County Assessors.



For relief under section 69, a claim must be filed with the Assessor of the county where the damaged/destroyed home is located.
For relief under section 69.3, a claim must be filed with the Assessor of the county in which the replacement property is located within three years after the replacement property is acquired or newly constructed.
For relief under section 2.1(b) of article XIII A of the California Constitution (RTC section 69.6), a claim must be filed with the Assessor of the county in which the replacement property is located within three years of the purchase or new construction of the replacement property for full relief. If this period is missed, prospective relief is available for the lien date of the assessment year in which the claim is filed.

1. My home was damaged by a fire. What do I do? Where do I start?

If your property has been damaged by a calamity, you need to file a disaster relief claim with the county assessor. This will allow your current property taxes to be reduced for that portion of the property damaged or destroyed. This reduction will be from the first of the month in which the damage occurred, and will remain in effect until the property is rebuilt or repaired. Some county assessors have the authority to reduce a property's value for damage without a disaster relief claim. Please check with your county assessor's office to verify whether a claim is required.
In addition, if your property has been substantially damaged or destroyed in a Governor-proclaimed disaster and you have either filed a disaster relief claim with the county assessor to reduce your taxes or have been granted disaster relief by the assessor, you may file a claim to postpone the next installment of property taxes that occurs immediately after the disaster. If you file a "property tax deferral claim" with the county assessor before the next property tax installment payment date, that payment will be postponed without penalty or interest until the county assessor has reassessed the property and you receive a corrected tax bill.
To qualify for deferral, for property receiving a homeowners' exemption, "substantial disaster damage" means damage amounting to at least 10 percent of its fair market value or $10,000 whichever is less. For all other property, the damage must be at least 20 percent of value. However, tax deferral is not available where property taxes are paid through impound accounts.

2. My property and/or home were damaged and the Governor proclaimed a disaster in my area. What type of relief is available?

If your property has been substantially damaged or destroyed in a Governor-proclaimed disaster, you may be eligible for a reinstatement of your homeâs previous base year value. To be eligible, you must file a disaster relief claim with the county assessor to reduce your taxes and rebuild the property in a like or similar manner. Alternatively, you may choose to buy another comparable property and transfer your base year value to the new property. You will not be able to do both.
Can I buy another house in the same county and transfer the base year value of my damaged house to my new house?
Yes, section 69 provides for this relief to you under certain circumstances:
The damaged property must amount to more than 50 percent of its full cash value immediately prior to the disaster. This applies to any type of real property, not just residences.
The property must be transferred to a comparable replacement property, acquired or newly constructed, within the same county and within five years after the disaster.
Comparability is crucial – the replacement property must be similar in size, utility, and function to the property which it replaces.
The replacement property must not exceed 120 percent of the full cash value of the property damaged or destroyed. Any amount of the full cash value of the replacement property that exceeds 120 percent of the full cash value of the damaged property (immediately prior to the damage) shall be added to the adjusted base year value of the damaged property. The sum of these amounts shall become the replacement property's replacement base year value.
Please contact your county assessor's office for an application.
Can I buy another house in a different county and transfer the base year value of my damaged house to my new house?
Under section 69.3, a principal residence that was damaged in an area that was a Governor-proclaimed disaster that occurred on or after October 20, 1991 may have its base year value transferred to a replacement residence in a different county only if the county has adopted an ordinance that allows such taxable value transfers. As of June 7, 2018, there are 11 counties that have such an ordinance: Contra Costa, Los Angeles, Modoc, Orange, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, and Ventura. The replacement residence must meet the following criteria:

It must be purchased within three years of the disaster.
Its market value must be of equal or lesser value than the market value of the damaged property immediately prior to the date of the disaster. Depending upon the year in which the replacement property is purchased, the market value of the damaged property is adjusted up to 115 percent when comparing with the replacement property.
It must be eligible for the homeowners' or disabled veterans' exemption (your principal place of residence).
Claims for this exclusion must be filed with the county assessor within three years of the purchase of the replacement property.

Under article XIII A, section 2.1(b), an owner of a principal residence who is a victim of a wildfire or Governor proclaimed natural disaster may transfer the taxable value of their primary residence to a replacement primary residence located anywhere in this state, regardless of the location or value of the replacement primary residence, that is purchased or newly constructed as that person's principal residence within two years of the sale of the original primary residence.

The claimant must be an owner and a resident of the original property, and therefore eligible for the homeowners' or disabled veterans' exemption, either at the time of its sale or within two years of the purchase or new construction of the replacement dwelling.
The damaged property must amount to more than 50 percent of its full cash value immediately prior to the disaster.
Either the sale of the original property or the purchase or new construction of the replacement dwelling, must occur on or after April 1, 2021.

Claims for this exclusion must be filed with the county assessor within three years of the date the replacement dwelling was purchased or the new construction of the replacement dwelling was completed.


3. After my property is rebuilt or repaired following the damage, will my property taxes be increased over what they were before?

No. Property owners will retain their previous factored base year value if the house is rebuilt in a like or similar manner, regardless of the actual cost of construction. However, any new square footage or extras, such as additional baths, will be added to the base year value at its full market value.

4. Our home was damaged from a forest fire last September and we had to move out while it is being repaired.Â  Are we still allowed the homeowner's exemption even though we have not returned to our house as of January 1?

Yes. Temporary absence from a dwelling for repairs made necessary by a natural disaster will not result in the loss of your homeowner's exemption as long as you have not established permanent housing elsewhere.
