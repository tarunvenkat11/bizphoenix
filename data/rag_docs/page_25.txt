If employer payroll records were lost or destroyed due to a disaster, it will be necessary to reconstruct the records in order to file any missing returns and remit any payroll taxes due. If information is not available to determine the exact wages paid, employers may make reasonable estimates based on the best information available. The EDD can provide employers with copies of previously filed reports which may serve as a basis for their estimates. For further information or to request copies of previously filed reports, call the Taxpayer Assistance Center at 1-888-745-3886.

Employers should consider using the Work Sharing program as a temporary alternative to any layoffs if business production or services have reduced.

Effective in tax years after September 11, 2001, qualified disaster relief payments (as defined in section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code [IRC]) made by an employer are not subject to PIT withholding or reportable as PIT wages under sections 13006, 13009(q), and 13009.5 of the CUIC. However, disaster relief payments paid by employers are subject to UI, ETT, and SDI (includes Paid Family Leave) unless excluded under section 938 of the CUIC, as payment resulting from the death of an employee.

A qualified disaster relief payment is defined by section 139(b) of the IRC as any amount paid to or for the benefit of an individual:

(1) to reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary personal, family, living, or funeral expenses incurred as a result of a qualified disaster,

(2) to reimburse or pay reasonable and necessary expenses incurred for the repair or rehabilitation of a personal residence or repair or replacement of its contents to the extent that the need for such repair, rehabilitation, or replacement is attributable to a qualified disaster,

(3) by a person engaged in the furnishing or sale of transportation as a common carrier by reason of the death or personal physical injuries incurred as a result of a qualified disaster, or

(4) if such amount is paid by a federal, state, or local government, or agency or instrumentality thereof, in connection with a qualified disaster in order to promote the general welfare, but only to the extent any expense compensated by such payment (as indicated in items 1-4 above) is not compensated by insurance or otherwise.

A qualified disaster is defined by section 139(c) of the IRC as:

(1) a disaster that results from a terroristic or military action (as defined in section 692(c)[2] of the IRC),

(2) a federally declared disaster (as defined in section 1033(h)[3] of the IRC),

(3) a disaster which results from an accident involving a common carrier, or from any other event which is determined by the Secretary (of Treasury) to be of a catastrophic nature, or

(4) with respect to amounts described in section 139(b) item (4) above, a disaster which is determined by an applicable federal, state, or local authority as determined by the Secretary (of Treasury) to warrant such assistance from the federal, state, or local government or agency or instrumentality thereof.

Additional information about emergencies and disasters can be found on the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services’ website.
