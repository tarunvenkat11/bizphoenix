            How much does it cost to buy insurance through Covered California?
          


              The best way to get a quick estimate of the price you would pay is

              Shop and Compare Tool. The price is based on your estimated income for the coverage
              year, your ZIP code, your household size and your age. If you are
              a low- or moderate-income Californian, you may get help buying
              insurance from Covered California through monthly subsidies that
              lower your premium costs so that you pay less for top-quality,
              brand-name insurance. Learn more about
              who qualifies for a subsidy.

How much does Medi-Cal cost?


              For many individuals who enroll in Medi-Cal, there is no premium,
              no co-payment, and no out of pocket cost. Some households will see
              affordable costs, such as a low monthly premium. For some Medi-Cal
              children, the monthly premiums are $13 per child up to a family
              maximum of $39 per month. In general, individuals in Medi-Cal will
              get the same health benefits available through Covered California
              at a lower cost.

2025 Los Angeles Fires

**Provider**: March 31, 2025.

### Description

Here's what you need to know before you return to your home.

Use damage maps from the Palisades and Eaton fires to check the status
        of your property.

Government inspectors are assessing all homes in the fire areas. On each
        home, you'll see a photo and an icon with one of these statuses:

If there's no icon on your home, inspectors haven't assessed it yet.

If your home was damaged, save a copy of the photo from the damage map.
        You may be able to use it when you
        file an insurance claim.

All areas are cleared for residents-only access. You may need an access
        pass to enter your neighborhood. You can get one in person at a
        Disaster Recovery Center.

        Cleanup and debris removal after wildfires is a 2-phase process. You can
        have it done at no cost to you.
      








          We will explain these phases. When they are complete, your property is
          ready for rebuilding.
        






Hazardous waste cleanup


          In Phase 1, the U.S. EPA cleans up everyday products that were in your
          home and can be dangerous.
        
These include:

Batteries
Cleaners and solvents
Fertilizers and pesticides
Paints and oils
Propane tanks and other pressurized products



How to get cleanup
Phase 1 is automatic for all residential properties.
There's no cost to you for this cleanup.
You don't need to do anything for Phase 1 cleanup to begin.


Cleanup statuses explained
Properties are being assessed and cleaned up by the EPA now.
Once the EPA assesses your property, it will have a status.
They will post that status in a sign on your property.

          You can also check this
          EPA map
          for the cleanup status of your property.
        


Phase 1 Complete
This status means the EPA has finished their cleanup work.

              Your property may not be safe yet. There can
              still be:
            

Hazardous waste that's buried
Health hazards like ash and asbestos


OR

Deferred to Phase 2

              This status means the EPA can't safely clean your property until
              debris has been removed.
            
It will be cleaned in Phase 2.




        See
        Phase 1 progress.






Debris removal


          In Phase 2, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) removes
          structural debris.
        
This includes:

Damaged foundations
Destroyed vehicles
Trees that are a hazard
Contaminated soil
Asbestos
Ash


          See the progress of this work in
          USACEâs debris removal map.
        



How to get debris removed
To get debris removed, you must choose to:

Opt in for free removal
OR
Opt out to arrange and pay for removal yourself


          There are no out-of-pocket costs for this service. If you have
          insurance, your insurer will be billed.
        

          Debris removal cannot start until Phase 1 cleanup is completed or
          deferred by the EPA.

**Provider**: Federal Emergency Management Agency

### Description

LA's recovery is Governor Newsom's top priority. See all state actions
        to support recovery and rebuilding on
        the Governor's website.

Local, state, and federal governments offer in-person help at disaster
          recovery centers.

Many public schools operating in fire affected areas were damaged or
          destroyed. Federal, state, and local government is coordinating to
          help schools resume instruction for students.

Currently, LA County is
          accepting Right of Entry forms
          for Phase 2. Once validated by the county, the U.S. Army Corps of
          Engineers assesses properties and begins debris removal.

The California State Water Resources Control Board is working with
          local water systems impacted by the fires to restore safe drinking
          water for residents.

South Coast Air Quality Management District and the California Air
          Resources Board are working together to measure air quality in your
          area.

Mobile monitoring survey #1 was completed on January 31, 2025.

Some elevated levels of methane, possibly from gas leaks, were
                detected. These results were reported to utilities and public
                health agencies for further investigation.

Mobile monitoring survey #2 was completed on February 19, 2025,
                and results will be posted when analysis is complete.

            How much does it cost to buy insurance through Covered California?
          


              The best way to get a quick estimate of the price you would pay is
              to use the
              Shop and Compare Tool. The price is based on your estimated income for the coverage
              year, your ZIP code, your household size and your age. If you are
              a low- or moderate-income Californian, you may get help buying
              insurance from Covered California through monthly subsidies that
              lower your premium costs so that you pay less for top-quality,
              brand-name insurance. Learn more about
              who qualifies for a subsidy.
            

              More information:
              Apply for Medical Insurance






How much does Medi-Cal cost?


              For many individuals who enroll in Medi-Cal, there is no premium,
              no co-payment, and no out of pocket cost. Some households will see
              affordable costs, such as a low monthly premium. For some Medi-Cal
              children, the monthly premiums are $13 per child up to a family
              maximum of $39 per month. In general, individuals in Medi-Cal will
              get the same health benefits available through Covered California
              at a lower cost.

            How much does it cost to buy insurance through Covered California?
          


              The best way to get a quick estimate of the price you would pay is
              to use the
              Shop and Compare Tool. The price is based on your estimated income for the coverage
              year, your ZIP code, your household size and your age. If you are
              a low- or moderate-income Californian, you may get help buying
              insurance from Covered California through monthly subsidies that
              lower your premium costs so that you pay less for top-quality,
              brand-name insurance. Learn more about
              who qualifies for a subsidy.

How much does Medi-Cal cost?


              For many individuals who enroll in Medi-Cal, there is no premium,
              no co-payment, and no out of pocket cost. Some households will see
              affordable costs, such as a low monthly premium. For some Medi-Cal
              children, the monthly premiums are $13 per child up to a family
              maximum of $39 per month. In general, individuals in Medi-Cal will
              get the same health benefits available through Covered California
              at a lower cost.

            How much does it cost to buy insurance through Covered California?
          


              The best way to get a quick estimate of the price you would pay is
              to use the
              Shop and Compare Tool. The price is based on your estimated income for the coverage
              year, your ZIP code, your household size and your age. If you are
              a low- or moderate-income Californian, you may get help buying
              insurance from Covered California through monthly subsidies that
              lower your premium costs so that you pay less for top-quality,
              brand-name insurance. Learn more about
              who qualifies for a subsidy.

How much does Medi-Cal cost?


              For many individuals who enroll in Medi-Cal, there is no premium,
              no co-payment, and no out of pocket cost. Some households will see
              affordable costs, such as a low monthly premium. For some Medi-Cal
              children, the monthly premiums are $13 per child up to a family
              maximum of $39 per month. In general, individuals in Medi-Cal will

              at a lower cost.

Mortgage relief

          Get mortgage relief for structures damaged or destroyed by the LA
          fires. The state worked with major lenders to offer this relief. Over
          400 lenders committed to:
        

Reduce or pause mortgage payments for 90 days
Waive late fees for 90 days

            Protect owners from new foreclosures or evictions for 60 days
          
Not report late payments to credit agencies



            You must contact your mortgage lender to get relief. It does not
            happen automatically.

          Get mortgage relief for structures damaged or destroyed by the LA

Reduce or pause mortgage payments for 90 days
Waive late fees for 90 days

            Protect owners from new foreclosures or evictions for 60 days
          
Not report late payments to credit agencies



            You must contact your mortgage lender to get relief. It does not
            happen automatically.
