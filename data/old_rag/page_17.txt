Cleanup and debris removal after wildfires is a 2-phase process. You can
        have it done at no cost to you.

We will explain these phases. When they are complete, your property is
          ready for rebuilding.

In Phase 1, the U.S. EPA cleans up everyday products that were in your
          home and can be dangerous.

These include:

Phase 1 is automatic for all residential properties.

There's no cost to you for this cleanup.

You don't need to do anything for Phase 1 cleanup to begin.

Properties are being assessed and cleaned up by the EPA now.

Once the EPA assesses your property, it will have a status.

They will post that status in a sign on your property.
