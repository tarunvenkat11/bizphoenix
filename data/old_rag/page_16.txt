Here's what you need to know before you return to your home.

Use damage maps from the Palisades and Eaton fires to check the status
        of your property.

Government inspectors are assessing all homes in the fire areas. On each
        home, you'll see a photo and an icon with one of these statuses:

If there's no icon on your home, inspectors haven't assessed it yet.

If your home was damaged, save a copy of the photo from the damage map.
        You may be able to use it when you
        file an insurance claim.

All areas are cleared for residents-only access. You may need an access
        pass to enter your neighborhood. You can get one in person at a
        Disaster Recovery Center.

Cleanup and debris removal after wildfires is a 2-phase process.

Cleanup of hazardous waste is Phase 1. It's free, automatic, and
        happening now. The EPA is assessing and cleaning each property.

Debris removal is Phase 2. It's free if property owners
        opt in by March 31, 2025.

Los Angeles County has more information on
        preparing to return home after the fires.
