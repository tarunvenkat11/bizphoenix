- Phase 1: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
            clears household hazardous waste
- Phase 2: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers clears
            structural debris
- For a detailed breakdown of Phase 1 progress, see the
                    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's progress
                      dashboard.
- Complete means staff finished removing hazardous waste,
                    found unsafe structural debris that requires Phase 2
                    cleanup, or could not gain access to the property.
- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will clear any unsafe
                    properties in phase 2.
- For a detailed breakdown of the Phase 2 process and current
                    status, see the
                    U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' progress dashboard.
- Property owners must submit opt-in Right of Entry forms for
                    the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete Phase 2.
                    Property owners that opt out of this process must cover
                    debris removal expenses and work.
- The progress bar measures the number of parcels that have
                    completed Phase 2 against the estimated total number of
                    eligible parcels.
- Complete means that structural debris has been removed from
                    the property and the parcel has been returned back to the
                    owner.

- Volatile Organic Compounds including benzene
- Stage 1: Mobile monitoring surveys: These capture a
            snapshot in time of toxic metals and volatile organic compounds
            (VOCs). This will help identify locations for stationary air quality
            monitoring sites. There were 4 mobile monitoring surveys: 2 in the
            Eaton Fire area and 2 in the Palisades Fire area.
- Stage 2: Stationary air quality monitors: They
            measure pollutants in the air. This includes particulates (PM2.5 and
            PM10), lead, arsenic, other toxic metals, and asbestos.
